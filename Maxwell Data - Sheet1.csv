"""late tier 1,2 and 3, up to 5"", explains the tardiness policy within Mawared HR system, it shows if a repeatable penalty has been applied to the same employee, in this case: being late to sign-in
","To address the concept of ""late tier 1,2 and 3, up to 5"" within the context of the Mawared HR system's tardiness policy, it's essential to understand how the system handles late sign-ins and the application of penalties.

The tardiness policy in the Mawared HR system is designed to manage and regulate employee attendance, specifically focusing on instances where employees sign in late. This policy is governed by a set of rules that define when an employee is considered late and the potential penalties that may apply.

Understanding Tiers: The mention of ""late tier 1,2 and 3, up to 5"" suggests a tiered system for categorizing the severity or frequency of late sign-ins. This implies that the system can track and differentiate between various levels of tardiness, potentially applying different penalties based on the tier.
Repeatable Penalties: The concept of a ""repeatable penalty"" indicates that if an employee is late multiple times, the system can track these instances and apply penalties accordingly. This feature helps in managing and discouraging habitual tardiness among employees.
Application of Penalties: The application of penalties is determined by the ""Apply Penalty If Employee Is Late"" field within the system. If this field is enabled, late arrivals can trigger penalties. However, if it's disabled, no penalties will be applied for late sign-ins.
Tardiness Penalties Calculation: The exact method of calculating tardiness penalties isn't detailed in the provided context, but it's implied that the system follows a specific set of guidelines or rules to determine the penalty amount or type based on the tier of tardiness.
Maximum and Minimum Sign-In Times: The system uses ""Maximum Sign In Time"" and ""Minimum Sign In Time"" to determine if an employee is late. Signing in after the maximum time can result in penalties, while signing in before the minimum time does not incur penalties, thanks to the ""Employee Can Sign In As Early As"" setting.
Given this information, the ""late tier 1,2 and 3, up to 5"" likely represents a scaling system of penalties where:

Tier 1 might represent a minor infraction with a small penalty.
Tier 2 and 3 could signify more severe instances of tardiness, with increasing penalties.
The mention of ""up to 5"" suggests there could be additional tiers or that the system allows for customization up to five tiers, each with its own penalty structure.
To accurately implement or understand the specifics of this policy within the Mawared HR system, including how penalties are calculated and applied across these tiers, it would be necessary to consult the system's administrative settings or documentation. Additionally, understanding the exact implications of each tier on employee penalties and how the system tracks repeat offenses would provide a comprehensive view of the tardiness policy's enforcement.

Could you provide more details on how you would like to apply or understand this policy within your specific context? This would help in offering more tailored guidance or explanations."
